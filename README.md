# TriviaGameBasic

GAMEPLAY:
     Launch the index.html file, click start, and answer the questions.  The game checks 
     to see if your answer is correct and keeps score for you.  You will be shown totals
     at the end. 

DEV NOTES:
  -  2 console.log statements in the startCountDown function can be enabled to see the timer work
  -  The questions are fixed in this demo.  They never change in content, order, or answer options   
  -  The game tracks correct, incorrect, and no response conditions
  -  I used the "string literals" to dynamically create the majority of the HTML

HOMEWORK NOTES:
     I originally made this with 10 sequenced DIV's containing a question DIV and 4 answer DIVs.
     After I got it working I thought it was cluttered and wouldn't scale.  Since we had extra 
     time, I made the code more dynamic.
