# TriviaGameBasic

### Game Play
---
Launch the index.html file, click start, and answer the questions.  The game presents 10 trivia questions for you to contemplate and respond to.  The application checks to see if your answer is correct and keeps score for you.  You will be shown totals at the end. 


### Development Notes
---
-  The questions are fixed in this demo.  They never change in content, order, or answer options   
-  The game tracks correct, incorrect, and no response conditions


### Homework Notes:
I originally pursued this assignment with 10 sequence DIV's containing a question DIV and 4 answer DIVs.  Once the initial version was working it was quite cluttered and it was clear it wouldn't scale.  This code represents my first meaningful effort into dynamically generated page content aimed at solving those problems.
